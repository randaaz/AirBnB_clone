# AirBnB Clone

## Project Description

The AirBnB Clone project is a command-line-based application that mimics the functionality of the Airbnb website. The primary goal is to create a simple and functional clone that can perform basic Airbnb operations.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the AirBnB Clone. It supports various commands to manage objects within the application, such as creating, updating, and deleting instances of classes.

## How to Start

To start the AirBnB Clone, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the command: `./console.py`

## How to Use

Once the command interpreter is running, you can use various commands to interact with the AirBnB Clone. Here are some examples:

- **Create an instance:** `create <class_name>`
- **Show all instances:** `all`
- **Show a specific instance:** `show <class_name> <instance_id>`
- **Update an instance:** `update <class_name> <instance_id> <attribute_name> "<new_value>"`
- **Delete an instance:** `destroy <class_name> <instance_id>`

## Examples

1. Creating a new instance:

- **Show all instances:** `all`

2. Showing all instances:

- **Show a specific instance:** `show <class_name> <instance_id>`

3. Updating an instance:

- **Update an instance:** `update <class_name> <instance_id> <attribute_name> "<new_value>"`

Example: update User 123 email "new email@example.com"
- **Delete an instance:** `destroy <class_name> <instance_id>`
